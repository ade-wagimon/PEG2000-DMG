**PEG2000-DMG** is a large, artificial lipid consisting of 414 atoms. This molecule is used as a lipid additive for the Moderna Covid Vaccine's lipid nano particle (LNP).

First, we need to generate the 3D structure of PEG2000-DMG. In this tutorial, we use the structure from PubChem (PubChem ID **10257450**). Because the structure was generated from a 2D sdf file, we need to optimize it manually for faster results,  then optimized with semiempirical AM1 approximation.

Next, we need to divide the optimized structure into several fragment molecules. In this tutorial, we will divide the structure into four fragments: **13C, 14L, EG, and TC**.

Next, each of the fragments were further optimized using `DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G` and then continued with a single point energy calculation using `HF` with `IOp(6/33=2,6/41=10,6/42=17,6/50=1)`. (For better results, I recommend using DFT or MP2 or MP4 instead of HF.)

Next, generate the `esp` file

After that, the `ac` file

and generate the `RSEP` file inpput using the ac file

Then, calculate the RESP to obtain the final `atomic charge`

Now, we have all the atomic charges and `mol2` files of the fragments.

Finally, we need to combine all the fragments, `charges, and atom types` to obtain the parameterized PEG2000-DMG molecule.


Happy Simulations!
